Recently, I have been reading up on reinforcement learning with Stanford's CS234 RL course. I liked it so much I took notes and put it up on my blog, check it out [here](https://timothydelille.com/notes/stanford-cs234-reinforcement-learning-lecture-2).

## Cartpole
I implemented Monte Carlo sampling and Q learning for the cartpole environment in `cartpole.ipynb`.
